Electric vehicles are rapidly transforming the transportation landscape, offering a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to traditional fossil-fueled cars. As the world moves toward greener mobility solutions, data becomes an essential tool to understand and support this global transition.
In my recent Python project, I dove into electric vehicle registration data to explore key trends and uncover insights about the most popular EV manufacturers on the road today. ðŸ“Š
Using pandas, I performed data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis. Then, with matplotlib, I brought those insights to life through clear and impactful visualizationsâ€”making it easier to interpret growth patterns and market preferences.
From identifying leading brands to observing regional adoption trends, this project demonstrates the power of data science in telling meaningful stories and driving innovation in clean energy.
Itâ€™s exciting to witness how technology and analytics come together to not only inform decisions but also help shape a more sustainable future.
